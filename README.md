# de-Finetti-Diagrams
R project for visualizing genotype distributions

To Do:
-------------------------

- Just make it a package with a function to read the data from biomark files and a function to call ggplot by what is desired. 
- Make markers that fail chi test red and text
- Make markers that pass chi just black dots. 
- Add an option to consider sample size. 
- Add an option to add an allele where there is zero (as Stew mentioned is a debatable practice).
